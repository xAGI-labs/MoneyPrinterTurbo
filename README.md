After downloading, it is recommended to **double-click** `update.bat` first to update to the **latest code**, then double-click `start.bat` to launch

After launching, the browser will open automatically (if it opens blank, it is recommended to use **Chrome** or **Edge**)

### Other Systems

One-click startup packages have not been created yet. See the **Installation & Deployment** section below. It is recommended to use **docker** for deployment, which is more convenient.

## Installation & Deployment üì•

### Prerequisites

#### ‚ë† Clone the Project

```shell
git clone https://github.com/harry0703/MoneyPrinterTurbo.git
```

#### ‚ë° Modify the Configuration File

- Copy the `config.example.toml` file and rename it to `config.toml`

#### ‚ë¢ Access the API Interface

Open your browser and visit http://0.0.0.0:8080/docs Or http://0.0.0.0:8080/redoc

### Manual Deployment üì¶

#### ‚ë† Create a Python Virtual Environment

It is recommended to create a Python virtual environment using [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/harry0703/MoneyPrinterTurbo.git
cd MoneyPrinterTurbo
conda create -n MoneyPrinterTurbo python=3.11
conda activate MoneyPrinterTurbo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### ‚ë° Install ImageMagick

###### Windows:

- Download https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php Choose the Windows version, make sure to select the **static library** version, such as ImageMagick-7.1.1-32-Q16-x64-**static**.exe
- Install the downloaded ImageMagick, **do not change the installation path**
- Modify the `config.toml` configuration file, set `imagemagick_path` to your actual installation path

###### MacOS:

```shell
brew install imagemagick
````

###### Ubuntu

```shell
sudo apt-get install imagemagick
```

###### CentOS

```shell
sudo yum install ImageMagick
```

#### ‚ë¢ Launch the Web Interface üåê

Note that you need to execute the following commands in the `root directory` of the MoneyPrinterTurbo project

###### Windows

```bat
webui.bat
```

###### MacOS or Linux

```shell
sh webui.sh
```

After launching, the browser will open automatically

#### ‚ë£ Launch the API Service üöÄ

```shell
python main.py
```

After launching, you can view the `API documentation` at http://127.0.0.1:8080/docs and directly test the interface
online for a quick experience.

## Voice Synthesis üó£

A list of all supported voices can be viewed here: [Voice List](./docs/voice-list.txt)

2024-04-16 v1.1.2 Added 9 new Azure voice synthesis voices that require API KEY configuration. These voices sound more realistic.

## Subtitle Generation üìú

Currently, there are 2 ways to generate subtitles:

- **edge**: Faster generation speed, better performance, no specific requirements for computer configuration, but the
  quality may be unstable
- **whisper**: Slower generation speed, poorer performance, specific requirements for computer configuration, but more
  reliable quality

You can switch between them by modifying the `subtitle_provider` in the `config.toml` configuration file

It is recommended to use `edge` mode, and switch to `whisper` mode if the quality of the subtitles generated is not
satisfactory.

> Note:
>
> 1. In whisper mode, you need to download a model file from HuggingFace, about 3GB in size, please ensure good internet connectivity
> 2. If left blank, it means no subtitles will be generated.

> Since HuggingFace is not accessible in China, you can use the following methods to download the `whisper-large-v3` model file

Download links:

- Baidu Netdisk: https://pan.baidu.com/s/11h3Q6tsDtjQKTjUu3sc5cA?pwd=xjs9
- Quark Netdisk: https://pan.quark.cn/s/3ee3d991d64b

After downloading the model, extract it and place the entire directory in `.\MoneyPrinterTurbo\models`,
The final file path should look like this: `.\MoneyPrinterTurbo\models\whisper-large-v3`

```
MoneyPrinterTurbo
  ‚îú‚îÄmodels
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄwhisper-large-v3
  ‚îÇ          config.json
  ‚îÇ          model.bin
  ‚îÇ          preprocessor_config.json
  ‚îÇ          tokenizer.json
  ‚îÇ          vocabulary.json
```

## Background Music üéµ

Background music for videos is located in the project's `resource/songs` directory.
> The current project includes some default music from YouTube videos. If there are copyright issues, please delete
> them.

## Subtitle Fonts üÖ∞

Fonts for rendering video subtitles are located in the project's `resource/fonts` directory, and you can also add your
own fonts.

## Common Questions ü§î

### ‚ùìRuntimeError: No ffmpeg exe could be found

Normally, ffmpeg will be automatically downloaded and detected.
However, if your environment has issues preventing automatic downloads, you may encounter the following error:

```
RuntimeError: No ffmpeg exe could be found.
Install ffmpeg on your system, or set the IMAGEIO_FFMPEG_EXE environment variable.
```

In this case, you can download ffmpeg from https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/, unzip it, and set `ffmpeg_path` to your
actual installation path.

```toml
[app]
# Please set according to your actual path, note that Windows path separators are \\
ffmpeg_path = "C:\\Users\\harry\\Downloads\\ffmpeg.exe"
```

### ‚ùìImageMagick is not installed on your computer

[issue 33](https://github.com/harry0703/MoneyPrinterTurbo/issues/33)

1. Follow the `example configuration` provided `download address` to
   install https://imagemagick.org/archive/binaries/ImageMagick-7.1.1-30-Q16-x64-static.exe, using the static library
2. Do not install in a path with Chinese characters to avoid unpredictable issues

[issue 54](https://github.com/harry0703/MoneyPrinterTurbo/issues/54#issuecomment-2017842022)

For Linux systems, you can manually install it, refer to https://cn.linux-console.net/?p=16978

Thanks to [@wangwenqiao666](https://github.com/wangwenqiao666) for their research and exploration

### ‚ùìImageMagick's security policy prevents operations related to temporary file @/tmp/tmpur5hyyto.txt

You can find these policies in ImageMagick's configuration file policy.xml.
This file is usually located in /etc/ImageMagick-`X`/ or a similar location in the ImageMagick installation directory.
Modify the entry containing `pattern="@"`, change `rights="none"` to `rights="read|write"` to allow read and write operations on files.

### ‚ùìOSError: [Errno 24] Too many open files

This issue is caused by the system's limit on the number of open files. You can solve it by modifying the system's file open limit.

Check the current limit:

```shell
ulimit -n
```

If it's too low, you can increase it, for example:

```shell
ulimit -n 10240
```

### ‚ùìWhisper model download failed, with the following error

LocalEntryNotfoundEror: Cannot find an appropriate cached snapshotfolderfor the specified revision on the local disk and
outgoing trafic has been disabled.
To enablerepo look-ups and downloads online, pass 'local files only=False' as input.

or

An error occured while synchronizing the model Systran/faster-whisper-large-v3 from the Hugging Face Hub:
An error happened while trying to locate the files on the Hub and we cannot find the appropriate snapshot folder for the
specified revision on the local disk. Please check your internet connection and try again.
Trying to load the model directly from the local cache, if it exists.
